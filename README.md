Task: Given a two-dimensional array ("grid") of characters and a word. Find all occurrences of the given word in the grid. The word can be found in all 8 directions (up, down, right, left and diagonally) at any point. A word is said to "lie in a direction" if all the characters match in that direction (not in a zigzag pattern).
